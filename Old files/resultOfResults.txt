==============================Q: What is good code?
A: Is the code that is:
1.Readable (is your code clean? can others understand your code?)
2.Scalable (when we grow bigger and bigger with our input how much does the algorithm or function slow down?)

==============================Q: What does the rule of "worst-case" mean?
A: It means that we always worry about the worst case, because when we talk about scalability we can never assume that things are going to go well (you don't know how the input is going to be). When we talk about Big O we always talk about the worst case scenario.

==============================Q: What does the rule of "eliminating constants" mean?
A: As the name says, if Big 0 is the product of multiple terms, constant terms are eliminated (constant terms are like static numbers, numbers like 1, 4, 5, basically anything that is not a variable).
We only care about when it scales, when the size of the input is getting larger and larger.

==============================Q: What does factorial time mean?
A: It means that the number of operations will be proportional to the factorial of the input.
**We will find ourselves writing algorithms with factorial time complexity when calculating permutations and combinations.**
Factorial is the multiplication of all positive integer numbers less than itself. For instance:
The factorial of 5, or _5!_, is:
```text
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```

==============================Q: What is a memory controller?
A: A memory controller is a device that manages the data flow between the CPU and system RAM.  
The memory controller acts as the middleman in these operations, ensuring that the proper information is retrieved from the right locations.  
**The closer the information is to the CPU and the less it has to travel, the faster a program can be executed.**

==============================Q: Why is it said that there are no integers in JavaScript?
A: There is only the [Number](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type) data type in JS that represents numbers.  
**Internally it is implemented as [IEEE 754](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value) double precision floating point number.**  
What it means is that - technically there is no dedicated data type that represents integer numbers.  
Practically it means that we can safely use only numbers that are safely representable by the aforementioned standard. And it includes integer values in the range: `[-9007199254740991; 9007199254740991]`. Both values are defined as constants: [`Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-number.min_safe_integer) and [`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-number.max_safe_integer) correspondingly.

    this.length = 0;
    this.data = {};
  }
  get(index) {
    return this.data[index];

    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
    return lastItem;
  }
  deleteAtIndex(index) {
    const item = this.data[index];
    this.shiftItems(index);
    return item;
  }
  shiftItems(index) {
    for (let i = index; i < this.length - 1; i++) {
      this.data[i] = this.data[i + 1];
    }
    console.log(this.data[this.length - 1]);
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
  }
}
const myArray = new MyArray();
myArray.push('hi');
myArray.push('you');
myArray.push('!');
myArray.pop();
myArray.deleteAtIndex(0);
myArray.push('are');
myArray.push('nice');
myArray.shiftItems(0);
console.log(myArray);

==============================Q: What are Hash Tables?
A: **Collections of { Key: Value } pairs**
A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly.  
It operates on the [hashing concept](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hashing/), where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value. (it will store the key and the value at the same address in memory - a "bucket")
```text
Input = Grape
Output (is always) = G7xpLLQ4
G7xpLLQ4 -> key:value
```

==============================Q: What is a Hash function?
A: A function that generates a value of fixed length for each input it receives. For any given input, the output will always be the same.  
Examples:
```text
Input = Grape
Output (is always) = G7xpLLQ4
Input = 5
Output (is always) = Ax67def0

==============================Q: Which data-structure is more efficient at looping over data: An Array or a Hash Table?
A: An Array.  
If your Hash Table has 50 addresses but only 3 addresses contain Keys, you would still have to access all 50 addresses to obtain those Keys.  
An Array is sequential in memory, which makes it more efficient in this regard.

A: Arrays are indexed, Linked Lists are not.  
If you want to access the 5th element in a Linked List, you have to start from the beginning of the list and traverse to the 5th element.  
In an Array, you can simply access the element at index 4 ( arr\[4\] ) to get the value of the 5th element.

==============================Q: What is the Big O of a lookup (traversal) operation on a Linked List/Double link list?
A: O(n)
e.g. We go through the whole linked list to check if an element is present. In the case of a double linked list it would technically be O(n/2) because we can start at both ends and if we know in which half of the list is what we are looking for, we can choose the optimal place to start.

==============================Q: What are the pros of using stacks and queues?
A: 1.Fast operations (such as removing or inserting, such as the end of the data structure)
2.Fast peek (we can access the very first item in a queue or the very top item in a stack)
3.Ordered (we have all our data ordered)

==============================Q: What is the rule for implementing a Binary Tree?
A: Each node can have a max of 2 children.  
So a node can have 0, 1, or 2 children.
And each child can only have one parent
Each node represent a certain state

==============================Q: What is a perfect binary tree?
A: A perfect binary tree has everything filled in, that means that all the leaf nodes are full and there is no node that only has one child, a node either has zero or two children. Also, the bottom layer of the tree is completely filled, nothings is missing

==============================Q: What properties does a perfect binary tree has?
A: 1.The number of total nodes doubles as we move down the tree
2.The number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all the other levels plus 1
```text
Level 0: 2^0 = 1
Level 1: 2^1 = 2
Level 2: 2^2 = 4
Level 3: 2^3 = 8
```
Based on that formula, we can find the number of nodes in a tree:
\# of nodes = 2^h - 1 **(h is the level, starts from count of 1)**
log nodes = height/steps (simplified version)
log 100 = 2
10^2 = 100

==============================Q: What does logarithmic time mean?
A: All that is saying is that the choice of the next element on which to perform some sort of action is one of several possibilities and only one needs to be chosen.
e.g. (usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search))

==============================Q: What is a binary search tree?
A: BSTs excel at preserving relationships, making them suitable for scenarios where maintaining order and structure is important.  
For instance, while a hash table lacks such relationships, organizing folders on a computer necessitates a hierarchical structure with parent and subfolders, which can be achieved using a binary search tree.  
1.In a BST, all child nodes to the right of a root node must have values greater than the current node. This implies that moving to the right within the tree leads to nodes with increasing values, while moving to the left results in nodes with decreasing values.
2.Due to its nature as a binary tree, each node in a BST can have a maximum of two children.

==============================Q: How does a binary tree become unbalanced?
A: A binary tree becomes unbalanced when new nodes are continually placed to the right of one node and its children or to the left of one node and its children (as opposed to spreading them out evenly to keep the left and right sides about the same height, the tree becomes really long on on side).

==============================Q: For an AVL tree, what is the equation of the balance factor?
A: -
**|h1 - h2|  <= 1** (Balance factor)  
**|h1 - h2|** can be equal to **\-1,0, or 1**.  
**h1** and **h2** are _subtrees of the same node_.  
The balance factor determines whether or not any given subtree of a tree is balanced.

==============================Q: What are the 4 rules of a Red/Black Binary Tree?
A: 1.Each node must be either Red or Black  
2.Root node must always be black  
3.A red node must always have a black parent node and black child nodes  
4.Every branch path (the path from root node to an empty leaf node \[null\]) must posess the exact same number of black nodes.  
Extras:  
A null leaf node is always considered to be black, even if it is marked red.  
A chain of 3 nodes can never be a valid Red/Black Tree.

==============================Q: What is a binary heap?
A: A binary heap is a binary tree with the following properties:  
1.It's a complete tree. All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which will have elements positioned as left as possible.  
2.It is either a Min Heap or a Max Heap.  
In a Min Heap the root element must be the smallest (or the one with the least importance) among all elements present in the tree.  
In a Max Heap the root element must be the largest (or the one with the higher importance) of all elements present in the tree.
3.And have a max of 2 children (like a BT)

==============================Q: What is a Graph?
A: A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.  
Technically Trees and Linked Lists are types of a Graph.

==============================Q: What is an undirected graph?
A: A graph whose nodes (vertexes) have no defined direction. A node (vertex) can only link to another node (vertex) if that other node (vertex) is also aware of the first node (vertex).  
Think of how Facebook works with friends. You cannot be someones friend on Facebook unless they are also your friend.

==============================Q: What is a cyclic graph?
A: A graph which contains a cycle.  
You can start at one node (vertex) and make your way back to that same node by following other nodes back to the node you started on.  
Cyclic graphs are really common in weighted graphs

==============================Q: What is an edge list?
A: A collection of edges (connections) which represent a graph.
e.g.
```javascript
// a third element can be inserted into each array to apply a weight graph e.g. [0, 2 ,88]
const graph = [
  [0, 2],
  [2, 3],
  [2, 1],
  [1, 3],
];
```

==============================Q: What is an adjacent list?
A: A collection of vertices and their neighboring vertices which represents a graph.
```javascript
// The index is the node and the value is the nodes neighbors (we can use arrays, objects, linked lists)
// The index in this case is the value of the actual graph node
const graph = [
  [2], // 0
  [2, 3], // 1
  [0, 1, 3], // 2
  [1, 2], // 3
];
```

==============================Q: What is an adjacent matrix?
A: A graph representation by an array matrix which contain 0s and 1s that show the relationship of vertices to other vertices in the graph.  
It will indicate if node X has a connection to node Y, 0 means NO, 1 means YES
If you have a weighted graph you can add weights here instead of 1 (is replaced by the weight) and 0
```javascript
// The index in this case is the value of the actual graph node
// We can use an object to apply keys instead of indexes
const graph = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0], // 0 -> 2
  [0, 0, 1, 1], // 1 -> 2,3
  [1, 1, 0, 1], // 2 -> 0,1,3
  [0, 1, 1, 0], // 3 -> 1,2
];
```

```javascript
function findFactorialRecursive(number) {
  //code here
  return answer;
}
function findFactorialIterative(number) {
  //code here
  return answer;
}
```
A: -
```javascript
function findFactorialIterative(number) {
  let answer = 1;
  // you actually no longer need the if statement because of the for loop
  // if (number === 2) {
  //   answer = 2;
  // }
  for (let i = 2; i <= number; i++) {
    answer = answer * i;
  }
  return answer;
}
function findFactorialRecursive(number) {
  if (number === 2) {
    return 2;
  }
  return number * findFactorialRecursive(number - 1);
}
findFactorialIterative(5);
findFactorialRecursive(5);
//If you want, try to add a base case condition for the recursive solution if the parameter given is less than 2
```

```javascript
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 ...
// the pattern of the sequence is that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values, that means that for N=5 → 2+3
//For example: fibonacciRecursive(6) should return 8
function fibonacciIterative(n) {
  //code here;
}
fibonacciIterative(3);
function fibonacciRecursive(n) {
  //code here;
}
fibonacciRecursive(3);
```
A: -

function fibonacciIterative(n) {
  let arr = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i < n + 1; i++) {
    arr.push(arr[i - 2] + arr[i - 1]);
  }
  return arr[n];
}
fibonacciIterative(3);
function fibonacciRecursive(n) {
  if (n < 2) {
    return n;
  }
  return fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) + fibonacciRecursive(n - 2);
}
fibonacciRecursive(6);

==============================Q: What are the rules/factors to consider when deciding to write a recursive function?
A: **Every time you are using a tree or converting Something into a tree, consider recursion.**  
1.Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem. e.g.(fibonacci / factorial problems)  
2.Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature. (the calculations that we need to do are pretty much the same)  
3.The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand. (if you solve the smaller problems and you combine them that solves the problem at hand)  
**Divide and Conquer using Recursion**
e.g. (looking through a phone book when you're looking for Bell in the phone book You're not going to start from a and simply go one page at a time from left to right. o you usually split the phonebook in the middle or try to go to the B section of the phone book and start dividing up the problem page by page until you get closer and closer)

A: -
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  let arrayStr = str.split('');
  let reversedArray = [];
  //We are using closure here so that we don't add the above variables to the global scope.
  function addToArray(array) {
    if (array.length > 0) {
      reversedArray.push(array.pop());
      addToArray(array);
    }
    return;
  }
  addToArray(arrayStr);
  return reversedArray.join('');
}
reverseString('yoyo master');
function reverseStringRecursive(str) {
  if (str === '') {
    return '';
  } else {
    return reverseStringRecursive(str.substr(1)) + str.charAt(0);
  }
}
reverseStringRecursive('yoyo master');

==============================Q: Why should we review the documentation of the (native) methods we are using?
A: To understand how it works in the language, it can also serve as a reference and a guide.  
For example, in the case of javascript the implementation of the sort() method will vary depending on the environment where it is executed, ECMAScript says how it should look like (grab this argument and return this), but does not talk anything about the implementation.

==============================Q: What does it mean when a sorting algorithm is stable?
A: If a sorting algorithm is stable then it will retain the original order of the data after sorting is completed.  
If there are duplicates of data then the duplicate piece of data that was on the left will remain on the left and the right will remain to the right after sorting is done.

==============================Q: How would you implement merge sort?
A: -
```javascript
const numbers = [99, 44, 6, 2, 1, 5, 63, 87, 283, 4, 0];
function mergeSort(array) {
  if (array.length === 1) {
    return array;
  }
  // Split Array in into right and left
  const length = array.length;
  const middle = Math.floor(length / 2);
  const left = array.slice(0, middle);
  const right = array.slice(middle);
  // console.log('left:', left);
  // console.log('right:', right);
  return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}
function merge(left, right) {
  const result = [];
  let leftIndex = 0;
  let rightIndex = 0;
  while (leftIndex < left.length && rightIndex < right.length) {
    if (left[leftIndex] < right[rightIndex]) {
      result.push(left[leftIndex]);
      leftIndex++;
    } else {
      result.push(right[rightIndex]);
      rightIndex++;
    }
  }
  // console.log(left, right)
  return result.concat(left.slice(leftIndex)).concat(right.slice(rightIndex));
}
const answer = mergeSort(numbers);
console.log(answer);
```

==============================Q: When should you use merge sort?
A: The main reason is its efficient time complexity of O(n log(n)) in both best and worst case scenarios. If one is concerned about worst case scenarios, merge sort is a suitable choice.  
However, if the goal is to sort data in memory and space complexity is a concern, merge sort can be costly because it requires O(n) space complexity. This means it uses a significant amount of memory.  
On the other hand, if there are large files that cannot be sorted within memory limits, external sorting is required. In this case, merge sort becomes a good option because space complexity matters less. External sorting involves using a process outside of the main memory to sort the data.  
In summary, merge sort is a favorable algorithm due to its efficient time complexity, making it suitable for worst case scenarios. However, if sorting in memory and space complexity is a concern, alternatives may be considered. For external sorting, such as with large files, merge sort is a good choice as space complexity becomes less significant.

==============================Q: When should you use quick sort?
A: Quicksort is superior to merge sort in terms of average case time complexity and space complexity. It has comparable speed to merge sort, but with lower space requirements. Quicksort is considered one of the most popular sorting algorithms.  
However, a drawback of Quicksort is its worst case scenario, where if the pivot is not chosen properly, the sorting process can become significantly slower. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when using Quicksort, particularly if worst case scenarios are a concern. In such cases, it may be advisable to choose a different sorting algorithm.

==============================Q: When should you use heap sort?
A: Heapsort is similar to quicksort and merge sort but has a space complexity of O(1), meaning it uses a constant amount of memory. However, in terms of average performance, heapsort is generally slower than quicksort in most cases.  
Heapsort is recommended only when there is a significant concern about worst-case scenarios and memory usage. In most situations, the text suggests that quicksort or merge sort would be the preferred choices for sorting algorithms.

==============================Q: What is the big O of BFS and DFS?
A: O(n)
**BFS:**
Time complexity is `O(|V|)`, where `|V|` is the number of nodes. You need to traverse all nodes.  
Space complexity is `O(|V|)` as well - since at worst case you need to hold all vertices in the queue.
**DFS:**
Time complexity is again `O(|V|)`, you need to traverse all nodes.  
Space complexity - depends on the implementation, a recursive implementation can have a `O(h)` space complexity \[worst case\], where `h` is the maximal depth of your tree.  
Using an iterative solution with a stack is actually the same as BFS, just using a stack instead of a queue - so you get both `O(|V|)` time and space complexity.
(\*) Note that the space complexity and time complexity is a bit different for a tree than for a general graphs becase you do not need to maintain a `visited` set for a tree, and `|E| = O(|V|)`, so the `|E|` factor is actually redundant.

==============================Q: What is BFS?
A: In this technique, each neighboring vertex is inserted into the queue if it is not visited. This is done by looking at the edges of the vertex. Each visited vertex is marked visited once we visit them hence, each vertex is visited exactly once, and all edges of each vertex are checked. So the complexity of BFS is V + E
**Pseudocode for BFS:**
> create a queue Q
>
> v.visited = true
>
> Q.push(v)  
> while Q is non-empty  
>    remove the head u of Q  
>    mark and enqueue all (unvisited) neighbours of u
Since we are only iterating over the graph’s edges and vertices only once, hence the time complexity for both the algorithms is linear **O(V+E)**.  
Auxiliary Space Taken is O(V) at worst case.

==============================Q: What is DFS?
A: While iterating with this technique, we move over each node and edge exactly once, and once we are over a node that has already been visited then we backtrack, which means we are pruning possibilities that have already been marked. So hence the overall complexity is reduced from exponential to linear.
**Pseudocode for DFS:**
> DFS(Graph, vertex)  
>     vertex.visited = true  
>     for each v1 ∈ Graph.Adj\[vertex\]  
>         if v1.visited ==  false  
>             DFS(Graph, v1)

==============================Q: What are the pros of BFS?
A: 1.Shortest path (It's very good for finding the shortest path between a starting point and any other reachable node because we always start off with the root node and then search the closest nodes first and then the nodes further)
2.Closer nodes (it will look at the closest node first)
